Upgrade notes
-------------

As usually, the upgrade follows the procedure:
1. You download the newer version of this package, and make a rootfs.bin.

2. Then you copy your rootfs.bin  to the target device's /tmp/rootfs.bin

3. Issue the command reflash on the target system. But i suggest you to
  try it first on a test-router or what, because if something goes wrong,
  you can detect it before you destroy your router... If an error is
  found, you can report it to me, and I'll try to fix it.

Anyway, good luck.
